This is a project to show the difference between the 24-Hour Passes Purchased (midnight to 11:59 pm) and the 3-Day Passes Purchased (midnight to 11:59 pm). 
This project was base on the data provided on the Citi Bike website from two links.
The two files are:

1. CitiBike.ipynb : Which has the code.
2. CitiBikejan-may.csv :  Which has the data collected from the files after getting the sum of every day passes purchased on every month from Jan - Jun 2019.
